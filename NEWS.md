# mapme.biodiversity (development version)

## General

  more information
- `get_chirps()` now allows to specify the years for which to download CHIRPS
  resources
- `calc_precipitation_chirps()` now only returns precipitation sums

  un-nest indicator columns and change the data layout to either long or wide
- changes the behavior of `write_portfolio()` to serialize portfolios to 
  GDAL supported spatial formats in either long or wide format and deprecates
  `read_portfolio()`

# mapme.biodiversity 0.6.0

## Breaking changes

# mapme.biodiversity 0.5.0

## General

- Quickstart vignette uses the WorldPop resource instead of CHIRPS, not
  relying on a working internet connection (#230).
  
## New features

- GFW resources and indicators include latest GFC-2022-v1.10 version (#203).
- Raster resources with a CRS different from WGS84 are now supported (#213).

## Breaking changes

- The argument `add_resources` to `init_portfolio()` is deprecated. This
  means that `get_resources()` has to be run in every new R session to make 
  resource available for further processing (#219).
- Rasters are now cropped to the spatial extent of an asset with setting 
  `snap="out"`, thus delivering a slightly bigger extent (#212).
  
- Speed improvements for GFW indicators (up to x10 for larger rasters) now
  require R package `exactextractr` to be installed. Also, it is advised
  to have the R package `landscapemetrics` installed to gain the full computation 
  speed improvement.
  
## Bug Fixes

- `calc_indicators()` checks for 0-length tibbles (#196, #199, #215).

  (e.g. single tiles, tiled rasters with and without temporal dimension, 
  single temporal rasters) (#211).
- Rasters are cropped using `snap="out"` by default (#212).
- `.read_raster_source()` now projects assets in case their CRS differs 
  from the portfolio (#213).
- tile indices for raster resources are now appended to the portfolio attributes
  as `sf` objects instead of being written to disk (#219).
- `.read_raster_source()` now applies a precision round-trip of 5 decimal point 
  to match rasters with slight changes in their spatial extent (#217).
- `register_resource()` and `register_indicator()` now issue warnings for 
  resources/indicators with names already registered and overwrites them (#220).


# mapme.biodiversity 0.4.0

## New features

- added new resource called `ucdp_ged` providing a database of violent conflict
  from 1989 to today

- added a new indicator called `fatalities` aggregating number of deaths
  by type of conflict on a monthly time scale based on the `ucdp_ged` resource.
  
- Added a new resource called `fritz_et_al` providing a raster layer of deforestation

- added a new resource called `fritz_et_al` providing a raster layer of deforestation
  drivers in tropical forests based on [Fritz et al. (2022)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcosc.2022.830248/full)

- added a new indicator called `deforestation_drivers` using the `fritz_et_al` resource
  to obtain information on the absolute and relative area driving forest losses in 
  assets for the period 2008-2019
  
- added two new exported functions `register_resource()` and `register_indicator()`
  which allow users to register custom functions for resources/indicators
  
- added a new vignette for the web-version of the package only informing
  about how to obtain wide-output from indicators
  
- added a new vignette for the web-version for a custom analysis of the NASA
  FIRMS resource in the example section

- added the data for years 2017-2020 to the Global Mangrove Watch resource 


## Breaking changes

- Changed the parallel backend to the [future](https://cran.r-project.org/package=future) 
  package. Parallel processing is now implemented by
  [furrr::future_map()](https://furrr.futureverse.org/reference/future_map.html)
  on the asset level within the calc_indicators() function. User code is now
  required to set up a [plan()](https://future.futureverse.org/reference/plan.html)
  to enable parallel processing. The function call needs to be wrapped on the user
  side with [progressr::with_progress()](https://progressr.futureverse.org/reference/with_progress.html)
  to show a progress bar.
  
- mapme.biodiversity no longer sets terra's temporal directory for you.
  Instead you have to call `terra::terraOptions()` manually

## Bug Fixes

- `esalandcover` indicator now returns the value per each land cover class 
  exactly once (#177)

## Internal

- disabled running examples on CRAN 

- disabled tests for get_* functions on CRAN

- `terra` engines now use `get()` to resolve the requested zonal
  statistic function

- applying tidyverse coding style to existing code (#156, @karpfen)

- extensive re-factoring of vector-raster zonal statistic engines (#150)

- extensive re-writing of testing infrastructure for indicator functions omitting
  the usage of snapshot tests as far as possible (#142)

- `rundir` and `todisk` arguments removed from indicator functions since they were
  of no practical use

- instead of a resource and indicator backlog, resources and indicators are now
  registered to .pkgenv and queried there during runtime. This also allows
  users to register custom resources/indicator functions
  
- removed deprecation warnings for old resource/indicator name
  


# mapme.biodiversity 0.3.0

## Breaking changes

- on MacOS s2-based calculations are now enabled so users can expect the package
  to return numerically equivalent results on any operating system (#131)
  
- the online source for the `nasa_srtm` resource shows an expired SSL certificate
  since November 2022. The `get_resources()` function now includes an error and 
  instructions how to disable SSL certification at a users own risk. The 
  websites maintainers have been contacted and asked to renew the certification. (#131)

## New features

- GFW resources are now updated to use the latest version allowing analysis for 
  the additional year of 2021 (#123, @fBedecarrats)
  
- GFW indicators now accept numeric `min_size` argument allowing to specify
  fractional covers (#110)
  
- fire indicators now allow the simultaneous calculation of indicators based on 
  MODIS and VIIRS. Before users had to chose between one of the instruments for
  each analysis (#126)
  
## Bug fixes

- case when one or multiple assets return NA instead of a tibble is now properly
  tested and handled (#101)

- Rasters are no longer temporary written to disk to omit a bug caused by 
  applying mask/classify to an already existing raster file (#108, @Jo-Schie)
  
- Bug with soilproperties set to NA caused by the function to return a data.frame
  instead of a tibble was fixed (#116)

- both, `treecoverloss_emissions` and `treecover_area_and_emissions` now return
  0 instead of NaN for observation years where now forest loss occurred (#120)
  
## Internal

- `.make_global_grid()` now specifies the CRS when constructing the bounding box
  and returns the grid in the specified CRS instead of Lat/Lon (#113)
 
- `.calc_active_fire_properties` now uses st_coordinates to retrieve locations
  of fires (#119, @DavisVaughan)
  
- tests for MacOS have been re-enabled (#131)

- tests for downloading `nasa_srtm` resource are skipped because the SSL certificate
  of the online source has expired (#131)


# mapme.biodiversity 0.2.1

## Bug fixes
- fixes a serious bug that occurred for tiled resources when multiple assets are within 
the same tile resulting in returning the same tile multiple times

## Internal
- tests to catch above mentioned bug have been introduced for tiled resources
